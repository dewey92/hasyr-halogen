Personal Todos written with Halogen. Currently WIP

Hasyr comes from the name of a chapter in Qur'an, Al-Hasyr, meaning "The Exile". It's supposed to banish all distractions during work and focus on the tasks at hand, as beatifully encouraged in its 18th verse.

> O you who have believed, fear Allah. **And let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow** - and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do. &mdash; Al-Hasyr:18
